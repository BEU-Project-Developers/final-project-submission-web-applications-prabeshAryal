    <p>
        Welcome to Music App. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information in relation to our web application services. Your privacy is important to us. This policy applies to all users of the Music App.
    </p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
        We collect information necessary to provide and improve our services. As this is currently a project focused on UI and structure, actual data collection might be minimal or simulated. In a full implementation, the types of personal information we might collect could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If user accounts are implemented, this could include your name, email address, and password (securely hashed).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, such as listening history, created playlists, liked songs, and artists you follow (if these features are implemented).</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Information automatically collected when you use the app, such as IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers. This helps us troubleshoot and improve performance.</li>
        @*<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience, remember your preferences, and analyze usage patterns.</li>*@
    </ul>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>
        The information collected would be used for purposes such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the Music App service.</li>
        <li>Improving, personalizing, and expanding our service (e.g., providing music recommendations based on listening history).</li>
        <li>Understanding and analyzing how you use our service to enhance user experience.</li>
        <li>Developing new features, products, and functionality (based on aggregate usage patterns).</li>
        <li>Communicating with you, potentially for customer service, updates, or informational purposes (if contact information is collected).</li>
        <li>Detecting and preventing fraud or security issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
    <p>
        As this is primarily a student project, your personal information is not actively shared with external third parties for commercial purposes. In a real-world scenario, we would not share your personal information except in limited circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We would share information if we have your explicit consent to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> If required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With trusted third-party vendors working on our behalf (e.g., hosting providers), under strict confidentiality agreements. (Not applicable to current project state).</li>
        @*<li><strong>Aggregated Data:</strong> We might share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</li>*@
    </ul>
    <p>
        Currently, data might only be visible to the developer (Prabesh Aryal) and the course instructor (Vugar Cebiyev) for academic evaluation purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we handle. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect potential future data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the current project state, sensitive data collection is minimal.
    </p>

    @*<h3>Your Choices</h3>*@
    @*<p>Depending on future features, you might have choices regarding your information, such as accessing, updating, or deleting your account data.</p>*@

    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
